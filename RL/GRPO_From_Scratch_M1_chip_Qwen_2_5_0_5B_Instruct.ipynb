        "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to build a distributed reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline using the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to finetune a language model for math, logic, and coding tasks. These are tasks for which there exist a unique correct answer that can be easily verified with the ground truth answer using a simple string comparison.\n",

We start with the basic setup and imports, then move on to data formatting and answer extraction, dataset preparation, evaluation functions, reward functions, training setup and execution, and finally loading and testing the model. In the process, we implement the GRPO algorithm from scratch.\n",
