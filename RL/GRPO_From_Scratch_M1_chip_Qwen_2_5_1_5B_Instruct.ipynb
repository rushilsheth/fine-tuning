These are tasks for which there exist a unique correct answer that can be easily verified with the ground truth answer using a simple string comparison.\n",

We start with the basic setup and imports, then move on to data formatting and answer extraction, dataset preparation, evaluation functions, reward functions, training setup and execution, and finally loading and testing the model. In the process, we implement the GRPO algorithm from scratch.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: The statement \"All dogs have four legs\" is false because there are some exceptions to this rule. While most dogs do indeed have four legs, there are also breeds of dogs such as poodles, beagles, and terriers that have different numbers of legs or even no legs at all (in the case of certain types of dogfish). Additionally, some animals that are not traditionally considered dogs, like cats and rabbits, also have four legs. Therefore, while it is true that most dogs have four legs, it is not accurate to say that all dogs have four legs without qualification. \n",

            "1. **Generalization**: When making generalizations about a group of things, it's important to consider the exceptions within that group. In this case, the exception would be any animal that doesn't have four legs.\n",

            "2. **Variability**: There is variability in the number of limbs an animal may possess. Some animals have more than four legs, some have fewer, and some don't have any limbs at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Contextual Understanding**: It's crucial to understand the context in which the statement is being made. For example, when discussing pets, it might be appropriate to generalize based on common knowledge, but when discussing scientific\n",
